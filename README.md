Case study: Data analysis and visualization to evaluate and recommend a business partnership. Team project for data-driven business with SQL and Tableau.

## Project

Eniac is a online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories. To enter the Brazilian market, Eniac is considering a partnership with Magist, a Brazilian company that offers a centralized order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces.

To help Eniac make an educated decision, two questions are at the core of this project.

1. Is Magist a good partner for high-end tech products?
2. Is Magist's delivery service fast enough?

We found that Magist represents a small tech sector and provides delivery services subpar to Eniac's expectations. Based on the provided data, we therefore do not recommend Magist as a partner at this time.
